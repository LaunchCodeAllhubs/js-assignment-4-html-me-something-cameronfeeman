         <h1>Zion</h1>
      </header>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Zion is an out of this world park you simply have to visit! Located in Utah, Zion is the states first National Park! With an elevation change of 5,000 ft from it's lowest point to it's highest, Zion is home to a diverse area of plant and animals. There is so much to see and learn but be sure to check out the following hikes.</p>
      <ul>
      <li> Angles Landing </li>
      <p> With high drop off's and switch backs this hike is not for everyone but the views cannot be beat!  </p>
      <li> The Narrows </li>
      <p> This hike takes you striaght into the Virgin River. You can hike for as long or as short as you'd like through this river. I highly reccomend renting the necessary gear as you can find yourself up past your knees in water depending on the time of year!</p>
      </ul>

         <h1>Arches</h1>
      </header>
      <p> Arches National Park contains the greatest density of natural arches in the world. I highly reccomend visiting this beautiful dessert landscape to see the wonders nature has formed over thousands of years. Arches is also an official International Dark Sky Park meaning the Park and nearby town have taken measure to elimnate light pollution. This creates a more natural environment for the nocturnl ecosystem that lives in this desert region. It also makes it an incredible place to go stargazing! Check out these hikes below.  </p>
      <ul>
         <li> Delicate Arch Trail</li>
         <p> This is the most famous and well known hike at Arches. But it's popular for a reason and I highly recommend it. This is the classic stand alone arch you see in pictures but seeing it person really is magical! </p>
         <li> Landscape Arch Trail </li>
         <p> Landscape Arch spans an incredible 306 feet making it the longest stone span in the world! It is also one of the older arches found in this park. It is also well know for it's slenderness and geologist aren't sure how long it will remain intact. </p>
      </ul>

      <h1>Bryce Canyon</h1>
   </header>
   <p> Bryce Canyon is made up of a series of natural amphitheaters carved into the edge of a high plateau. It is home to the greatest number of hoodoos on Earth. A hoodoo is an odd-shaped rock, or spire, left standing by the forces of erosion. It is incredible to see these natrually formed formations. Check out these hikes below. </p>
   <ul> 
      <li> Navajo Loop Trail</li>
      <p> This trail begins at Sunset Point and is composed of narrow switch backs through the towering pink and orange limstone walls. </p>
      <li> Queen's Garden Trail </li>
      <p> This trail begins at Sunrise Point and is commonly combined with Navajo Loop Trail. Use this trail to view the Queen Victoria hoodoo.</p>
   </ul>
